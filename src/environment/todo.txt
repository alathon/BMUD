Redesign room_manager.dm, room_cluster.dm:

- Switch away from uppercase first-letter procedure names
- Clarify the role of the room_manager (Which should be named
  roomManager)
- Hide private functions behind __ prefix
- Don't allow the creation of unnamed rooms/clusters, or at least
  mark them as invalid
- Build up skeleton for OLC to be implemented on top of.

On OLC:

- Abstract away saving/loading so you can use savefiles OR MySQL DB
  depending on what you want.
