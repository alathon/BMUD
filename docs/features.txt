- Feature-rich command parser and methods for gathering client input
- Basic room/area structure with exits, descriptions, etc.
- A very basic set of commands to interact with the world, such as:
	- Who, look, get, drop, etc.
- Item stacking, containers, etc.
	- Various basic, straight-forward systems that most MUDs need for
	  items
	- Items which are meant to, can stack.
	- Items can be put into, gotten from containers [NOT TESTED YET]
	- Rudimentary skeleton to implement any sort of
	  inventory/container-related control, such as giving items a size,
	  weight, etc. [NOT QUITE THERE YET]
- Easy event scheduling for anything in the game [TODO]
- Modular 'services' that can be loaded/unloaded dynamically, while the
  game is running. [IS THIS EVEN USEFUL? CONSIDER BOOTLOADER INSTEAD]
- Standard 'copyover' functionality for saving the state of the world,
  re-compiling and reconnecting everyone to where they were before.
  [TODO]
- Handles linkdeath and reconnecting after going linkdead [TODO]
- Basic notion of 'game state' and 'combat state' [TODO]
- Example of implementing very simple combat & two classes, using unique
