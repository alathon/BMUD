Variable scope:

- Private variables and functions should be prefixed by __

Folder/file structure:

- The following folders exist for code:
	- environment: Code related to the physical environment, such as
	rooms, zones and similar
	- character_creation: Code related to the creation of characters
	- parser: Commands and parser-specific code
	- input: Code related to recieving and outputting to the user

If something doesn't fit into a folder, there are two options:

1) Put it in the base directory, alongside the .dme
2) Create a new folder for the file. This should only happen if more
than one file can be in the folder.
